# Uber-and-Lyft-Prices
This Repository compares the prices for Uber and Lyft for the Boston Region for the month of November and December. This repository is very useful to understand the nuances of EDA and Regression models. Also, it holds the dashboards that can be prepared using Power BI. 
There are several number of columns in the dataset. We can understand how to filter which columns to keep and to keep the track of the model to be selected based on the R squared values since it is a Regression Model.
